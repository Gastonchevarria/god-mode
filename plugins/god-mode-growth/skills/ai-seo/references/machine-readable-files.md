### Machine-Readable Files for AI Agents

> **Google's stance**: not required for AI Overviews or AI Mode. Their guide explicitly says you don't need new markup, AI files, or markdown to appear in generative AI search.
>
> **Why include them anyway**: non-Google AI engines (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) and autonomous buying agents do reward extractable structure. The files below help with those engines without harming Google.

AI agents aren't just answering questions — they're becoming buyers. When an AI agent evaluates tools on behalf of a user, it needs structured, parseable information. If your pricing is locked in a JavaScript-rendered page or a "contact sales" wall, agents will skip you and recommend competitors whose information they can actually read.

Add these machine-readable files to your site root:

**`/pricing.md` or `/pricing.txt`** — Structured pricing data for AI agents

```markdown
# Pricing — [Your Product Name]

## Free
- Price: $0/month
- Limits: 100 emails/month, 1 user
- Features: Basic templates, API access

## Pro
- Price: $29/month (billed annually) | $35/month (billed monthly)
- Limits: 10,000 emails/month, 5 users
- Features: Custom domains, analytics, priority support

## Enterprise
- Price: Custom — contact sales@example.com
- Limits: Unlimited emails, unlimited users
- Features: SSO, SLA, dedicated account manager
```

**Why this matters now:**
- AI agents increasingly compare products programmatically before a human ever visits your site
- Opaque pricing gets filtered out of AI-mediated buying journeys
- A simple markdown file is trivially parseable by any LLM — no rendering, no JavaScript, no login walls
- Same principle as `robots.txt` (for crawlers), `llms.txt` (for AI context), and `AGENTS.md` (for agent capabilities)

**Best practices:**
- Use consistent units (monthly vs. annual, per-seat vs. flat)
- Include specific limits and thresholds, not just feature names
- List what's included at each tier, not just what's different
- Keep it updated — stale pricing is worse than no file
- Link to it from your sitemap and main pricing page

**`/llms.txt`** — Context file for AI systems (see [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org))

If you don't have one yet, add an `llms.txt` that gives AI systems a quick overview of what your product does, who it's for, and links to key pages (including your pricing).

**`/okf/` — Open Knowledge Format bundle (Google-backed, v0.1)**

Google [introduced OKF](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-the-open-knowledge-format-can-improve-data-sharing) in June 2026 — a markdown spec for representing site content as a directory of cross-linked files with YAML frontmatter, agent-readable without scraping. Built primarily for data-team catalog metadata; the site-readable-by-agents repurposing was popularized by Suganthan Mohanadasan. No confirmed AI-search ranking signal today — treat it as protocol-layer registration like early schema.org. **For the full breakdown, implementation paths (free generator, WordPress plugin, by-hand), hosting guidance, and when to skip, see [references/okf.md](okf.md).**

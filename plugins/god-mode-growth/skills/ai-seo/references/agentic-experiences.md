## Agentic Experiences

Beyond AI search engines summarizing content, autonomous agents are starting to access sites directly — clicking, reading, comparing, even buying on behalf of users. Google's guide flags this as an emerging category to plan for.

**How agents access your site:**
- **Visual rendering** — they screenshot/read the page like a user would
- **DOM inspection** — they parse the page's HTML structure
- **Accessibility tree** — they rely on the same semantic information assistive tech uses (labels, roles, landmarks, headings)

**What to do:**
- **Render meaningful content without heavy JS gymnastics** — if the page is blank until 4 frameworks finish loading, agents see blank
- **Semantic HTML** — use `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<button>`, proper heading hierarchy, `alt` text on images
- **Clean accessibility tree** — every interactive element labelled; ARIA used correctly (or not at all when native HTML suffices)
- **Stable selectors / predictable layouts** — agents struggle with sites that re-render every interaction
- **Visible pricing, specs, contact info** — anything an agent would need to make a buying recommendation should be on a public, indexable page (this is where `/pricing.md` and similar files help)

**Emerging — Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP):**
Google references UCP as a forthcoming protocol that will give agents standardized hooks for commerce interactions (catalog discovery, pricing, checkout). Watch for adoption; for now, the structural recommendations above are the precursor.

For ecom and local business specifically, Google highlights:
- **Merchant Center feeds** + **Google Business Profile** for product/service visibility in AI Search
- **Business Agent** for conversational customer engagement (where applicable)
